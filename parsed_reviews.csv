1,Nihada S.,5.0,2019-07-27,"This place has to be one of the absolute best places in San Jose, if not the Bay Area. The food is so damn good, it really doesn't compare to anything else. There are some cons to this place, but the foods so good I'm keeping the review at 5 stars. 
Cons: sketchy area, located in a little liquor store, I love the salsa but I can see it being too hot for some people, cash only, a lil pricey
Regardless, this place is deserves the 5 stars"
2,Brian D.,4.0,2019-07-11,"It's in a convenience store 
The guy makes pretty good food
See my photos 
The tacos are super cheap and you do get avocado  and cilantro fit like $2!
The store has Hemp cola!
And Real Pepsi and Coke from Mexico in glass bottles
The quesadilla was only so so 
The burrito was gigantic! ( pics included)
I mean it could pass as a baby in a blanket big!!  
I will go back as my friend runs a business a block away! The cops like it too!"
3,Eric W.,4.0,2019-02-26,"It's the unexpected places is when you discover something delicious.  Imperio Taqueria is no exception, located inside a liquor store is a hole in the wall that serves some delicious tacos .  

Was working in the area and boyz mentioned the shrimp taco is worth checking out.  The shrimp is made fresh to order.  Each taco contains 3 grill shrimp loaded with grill onions and cheese.  Add some lime and hot sauce, you got  yourself some good tacos that will have you coming back.

Located right across from the Delmas VTA lightrail station. Street parking only.  This place is cash only."
4,Melissa E.,5.0,2019-07-04,"I've been going here for the last four years! They have really good tacos and burritos!   Antonio is very clean while cooking,washing his hands in between each customer! And the salsa is off the hook!! I work close by so it's very convenient for lunch!!"
5,Chris S.,5.0,2018-11-05,"4 and a half stars, located inside of a convenience store, on the ""wrong"" side of the highway, cash only...everything added up to this being an amazing Mexican place, and it totally was.

Sure, maybe it's just that they fry everything (presumably in distilled deliciousness), but damn is it good. I got the burrito and the quesadilla and man oh man, those were some fantastic foods. They were out of chorizo (I can only imagine how good that must be), so I went with suadero (brisket) and el pastor.

I think my favorite was the qusadilla which is crazy in that I'm usually not a huge fan of them, but the favor was an explosion of awesome.

The salsa is also really good; it's definitely spicy, too. Don't forget to ask for extra.

Although the variety might not be here compared to some other mexican restaurants (and vegetables are few and far between), this might be one of my favorite Mexican places ever.

The biggest issue is that the parking in this neighborhood is ""permit only"" ""at all times"" which kinda sucks. I guess your choices are to brave it and hope, to pay for parking nearby (SAP center stuff?), or to uber in? Not sure. I know it's not their fault but it's still annoying.

I'll happily return here and risk being towed anytime :) (well, not during an event at the arena because I'm sure they actually do check parking then)"
6,Brian S.,5.0,2019-04-10,"This taco place is LEGIT! If you are looking for truly authentic tacos, head to this hole-in-the-wall taqueria that's inside of a convenience store close to downtown San Jose and the SAP Center. Everything about their tacos are perfect, from the perfectly seasoned and grilled meats, to the cilantro and grilled onions, to the amazing salsas, to the pickled jalape√±os. The prices are also right at $2.25 each, and service is super fast. They have other Mexican favorites as well, but I can't get past how yummy the tacos are to try any of them!"
7,Jeff F.,3.0,2019-01-10,"Don't understand the hype. Carna Asada was the best of the three tacos I had but not worth a return visit. Pollo and carnitas were a miss

Did love that this place was in a grocery store"
8,Giao L.,5.0,2018-03-05,"Why am I just discovering you now??

This place is the epitome of a hidden gem. I've driven by multiple times but never realized there was a taqueria inside their corner liquor store. In two weeks since discovering this place, I've been here 3 times. The employees behind the counter have always been friendly and, even though the woman that works the weekend shift doesn't seem to speak English, she completely understood my order (I know zero Spanish) and was friendly throughout. 

THE MEAT. Don't get me started on the al pastor. It is so tender and delicious, it's what's been bringing me back. I had both the al pastor taco and burrito. The taco was good, but whatever sauce they put on it is SPICE-Y. It hurt so good. But for the sake of my body, I'll probably ask them to skip that sauce in the future. The burrito is huuuge and stuffed with goodness--all for $9. My BF and I split one and that was the perfect amount for the both of us. Can't wait to come back and try the shrimp burrito everyone is raving about."
9,Osvaldo M.,5.0,2019-06-04,"Well deserved ratings. This is authentic Mexican food so the salsa might be too spicy for those who are not used to it. Taqueria is on point, the liquor store not so much."
10,Fonz C.,5.0,2019-02-02,"Great food, very friendly people and good service. 
I recommend this hole on the wall at any time."
11,Yoon C.,4.0,2018-04-19,"Uh...food is good but the place was sketchy when we went. There is NO SEATING and if you go during night time there might be some sketchy people outside......  There was only one worker who seemed to be bored because there wasn't any customer. But this might be due to the time we went. Usually I'm not too comfortable with a place with 0 customers because food is just sitting there. 

However. I suggest if you are already close by give it a try. But I wouldn't go out of my way to drive here to eat."
12,Emily X.,4.0,2018-04-13,"My hubs and I wanted to try a different taco place from our usual location (Spartan taco). We looked on Yelp and saw this and decided to give it a try. Not gonna lie at first I was a little sketch bc it was located inside of a liquor store. Walked in and no one was there. The lady who worked in front that night looked kinda mad, did not smile. 
Regardless we ordered 3 lengua and 3 pastor tacos. 

Lengua: 3/5 not the best lengua I've had. Honestly Seattle set my bars so high for lengua that I cant seem to find a place that makes lengua tacos as good as Seattle. The meat was chewy and I literally felt like I was chewing on tongue. Go figure since lengua is tongue. But the lengua I had in Seattle was crispy, fatty, and melted in the mouth. This is was just chewy. 

Al pastor: 4/5 so glad this one saved me! Full of flavor and she really gave you a lot of meat. There was a lot more liquid than I'm used to and maybe it's because they keep their meats already cooked and in a warmer tub."
13,Jaime D.,5.0,2018-02-09,"I can't believe i just discovered this place, simply delicious. It's tough sometimes to find a juicy burrito, but this place has it. The meats tender and juicy with thick slices of avocado. 

I'm simply in love! Cash only doe."
14,Lan T.,4.0,2018-07-11,"The shrimp burrito is real.  I'm guessing they use medium-sized shrimp (not the small mini type).  You also get quite a few pieces of shrimp in the burrito.  If you can get over the odd location, I highly recommend checking this place out.  Also, it's cash only!"
15,Ray B.,4.0,2018-04-16,"Did not except a great burrito from the shady convenient store on the corner-right down the street from the San Jose Caltrain station.
It's the classic ""I passed this place this place a million times"" and never thought to get food here. 
I had one of those back to back meeting days and all the places I would normally go were too far away.
I walked over to grab some lunch and was pleasantly surprised by the quality and taste of the food.
I went a 2nd time and I had no choice but to give I.T. another star. The food was just as good as it was the first time.

16,Ali M.,4.0,2016-06-30,"Yummy tacos for super cheap! Located inside the Delmas Market on the corner of Delmas and San Fernando in downtown SJ. This place is within walking distance from my work so my coworkers and I frequent it pretty often. The staff is friendly, food is yummy and inexpensive and the kitchen looks really clean. You can call ahead and pre-order so that you do not have to wait if you are on your lunch. I usually get the tacos but I have also tried the quesadilla and it was good too. 

Only downside is that it is cash only, as most taquerias are. They do have an atm inside the market though just in case you need it. If you are in the area and craving some tacos I would recommend you stop by and give them a try!"
17,Josh A.,5.0,2018-12-20,"Great place to swing by and pick up some Mexican food.  I like how they maintain a good variety of flavorful meats, one of the better stops that I've been to, located inside the Delmas corner market."
18,Hugo J.,5.0,2018-11-07,"Definitely good stuff here and this place has gone to the top of my list for authentic tacos.

I only get the tacos, which are large and meaty, and a good price. Five tacos are more than plenty for me and I have a huge appetite.

Be aware that the salsa is spicy and not for those who shy away from some heat. Get the salsa on the side and enjoy some very good food.

Also, know that this is a very sketchy neighborhood and there is no place within the liquor store to eat. You may have to eat in your car or take it to go."
19,Steven T.,4.0,2017-02-02,"It was a dark and dreary evening, and I needed to break the spell. I had been cooped up in the House for over 48hours and it started feeling like lockdown.

I decided to brave the streets of downtown SJ for some fresh air, and to fill the hole in my belly.

So many choices for food, but was really just thinking about having a beer with local street residents and soaking up the environment.

Since I wasn't that interested in a 40oz, I decided on some Mexican Food.

I found my way to Imperio Taqueria. Had walked past hundreds of times, but never had any cash money on me to spend.

I was greeted by a nice cook who was filling in for the evening.

I was hankering for a quesadilla, but then I saw they can serve up Shrimp Burritos. Sounds good to me, I am getting tired of Al Pastor anyways.

So to describe the burrito. Perfecto.

The SUPER SOFT flour shell was grilled on the stove top, the shrimp was perfectly cooked (see video). This burrito was good size, and packed with fillings.

The only thing that was skimped on was my side salsa, it is my only voice of concern.

They even supplied me with the authentic jalape√±os, carrots, and limes on the side. 

This place is worth a visit or three. For reference you can sneak to it before or after a Sharks game."
20,Andrea M.,5.0,2018-08-06,I live down the street and come here are least twice a week for their chicken tacos. So good. Antonio is a friendly face and is always upbeat!
21,Irene O.,1.0,2018-12-02,"The food itself isn't the worst I've tried, but what is very disheartening about this place is that the customer service and sanitation is horrible. The lady was so rude and we were polite and kind. I asked simple questions and she would respond snappy. The customer service isn't the worst part. I don't usually write negative reviews even when customer service is shitty. SHE MADE OUR FOOD WITHOUT GLOVES AND WRAPPED MY BURRITO SO HORRIBLY, I took one bite and the whole thing fell apart. The rice in the burrito was just mush. I do not recommend this place at all. Go somewhere else is you can."
22,Tom K.,5.0,2019-01-28,"Had the shrimp burrito which was excellent.  The place is a grill inside a tiny market near SAP center.  If you think that Chipotle sets the standard for Mexican food then don't come to Imperio.  If you love Mexican food that comes with a plate of carrots, jalape√±os and limes then come here.  Loved it, can't wait to try the tacos."
23,shomit J.,5.0,2018-07-21,Guys I'll save you the details but best burrito in town and I know I eat many of them
24,P. M.,5.0,2018-01-11,"Awesome, authentic, convenient, clean Mexican food in the funkiest of locations. Pickled carrots are spicy as hell. 

Cash only."
25,Nia R.,5.0,2018-04-09,"Amazing, everything, I've tried dozens of taquerias and no tacos can beat these. And to top it off not only are the Tacos the best the burritos, quesadillas, all of their items are better than anything I've ever tried. I've brought dozens of friends and family here and they all beyond agree with me!"
26,Nadia S.,5.0,2016-03-11,"I've been to MANY taquerias and I have to say this is by far my FAVORITE. Not only are the tacos BOMB (I had carne asade, pastor, and pollo), but they cost less than two bucks a pop. 

This is just a few blocks away from the SAP center inside Delmas Market. Must have just opened because it is quiet Friday at lunchtime.

Only thing I wish they had are chips. Anyone who swings through downtown San Jose MUST try this one. It is well worth it!"
27,Cristal C.,5.0,2016-01-03,"Since I've moved in the area, I frequent the Delmas Market and was always skeptical of liquor store taquerias. I have my reservations about those taquerias because I got really bad food poisoning at one before. However, Imperio keeps their kitchen exceptionally clean and always wash their hands after taking orders and handling the cash. 
As for the food they definitely know how to do amazing and high quality Mexican food. The items they carry are tortas, tacos, burritos and quesadillas. Though they have a limited selection of dishes, they have an extensive choice of meats. Their meats include: carne asada, carnitas, al pastor, chicken, brisket, cabeza, lengua, goat, and a couple of other selections as well. Their ingredients are such high quality and super fresh. The rice is nice and fluffy and their beans are always cooking on the stove. Although they only have one type of red sauce, it is quite spicy, so if you don't like the heat then skip it. This food is so flavorful that it doesn't really need salsa. Overall, if you're at the SAP Center or in the Delmas neighborhood area then definitely take advantage of this little known taqueria."
28,Quintana V.,5.0,2018-03-31,I come here on weekends whenever it's 2am when I'm up and feeling hungry  I love their quesadillas they are BOMB
29,Miz C.,5.0,2018-01-31,Awesome bodega taqueria. The lady was super friendly when asking me what all I wanted in my GIGANTIC burrito. Definitely worth a visit.
30,Thomas H.,5.0,2017-01-26,"This place is nothing to look at and is cash only, but the food is so good. The price and portions are on point. There are a couple parking spots behind the building, but its walkable from downtown.

I go for the vegetarian quesadilla - always so so good. Only about $7."
31,Jason S.,5.0,2015-11-09,"Always heard about Imperio Taqueria when I lived on the EastSide. (Original: Imperio Liquors & Taqueria @ the corner of King and San Antonio) So many people through my time in San Jose would be like ""Have you been to Imperio?"" like a weird amount ..so I feel like it is a staple of the ES.

But now they got a new location inside of the Delmas Market. Close for me now that its down the street from where I work. Tacos were bomb. dude hooked it up fat. and it was surprisingly nice/clean inside. Diff from that little window they serve you from over on King!"
32,Laura P.,5.0,2018-01-17,"My roommates and I moved in around this area and were thrilled to find out we had a taqueria so close by. This place is our go to! The taqueria is always super quick, friendly, and the food is booooomb. My friends and I all get a variety of things from the menu and none of us have ever had a bad thing to say about the food or our experience there. Awesome hole in the wall spot."
33,Sash H.,5.0,2017-11-24,Super authentic burrito. Hate to tell anyone but the price is reasonable for the fat super burrito you get. Nothing fancy all food is Togo but they provide a plate napkins and fork so you can eat it comfortably.
34,Frank c.,5.0,2016-11-22,Great location.  Great pricing.  At $7 for a super burrito with cheese and avocado it's awesome.  And the taste is delicious.
35,Sara D.,5.0,2016-10-08,"Literally sooooo good! Went with the reviews and god the shrimp burrito and it's amazing, and so filling! Service was friendly and really patient. Cash only. DEF COMING BACK"
36,A W.,5.0,2017-11-03,My first time checking them out it seemed strange that it's in a store but really convenient. It's super close to the sap center so we went early and decided to get some food this was the closest. The tacos were really great and cheap. The women was really friendly. We'll go again anytime we're hungry before a game!
37,Fullmoon T.,5.0,2016-05-11,"I've been on a Taco Crawl/Quest for some time now. I don't live in San Jose anymore nor am I familiar with the popular fast food ghetto taco eateries anymore. I once knew all the ""greasy spoons""/ ""hole in the walls"". I've tried several places in Santa Clara which were over priced and just down right Yuckafied. One place tried to serve me hamburger meat tacos. I asked for Carne Asada which means Grilled Meat WTF? I got my money back. Highly disappointed!
I went back to El Rancho liquor store/taqueria but it's not the same. I tried Jalisco's down the street but I've never had anything other than the Chile Verde burritos which I've been a fan of for many, many years and still am. The carne asada style tacos at Jalisco's is good but not what I was looking for. (read Extra Picky)
We (wifey and I) did a ""Taco Crawl"" one weekend from various ""holes in the wall"" but I still was not satisfied. I was looking for a Fresh Carne Asada taco where they marinate the meat so it's Tender (not old & dried out), topped with fresh cilantro and small chopped onion, dynamite salsa and lemon wedges (Not dried out limes). I didn't think I was asking for much. The only other place I could find a delicious taco was in my kitchen. I'm a gourmet cook but it's nice to take a break once in a while.
Disappointment after disappointment I thought about a place I used to frequent back in my younger days. So one Sunday after church I decided to venture out back to the ghetto to see if this place still existed and to my surprise it did. My old friend ""The greasy spoon"" Imperio taqueria where they make ghetto fab tacos are still going strong. The old run down paint chipping off the dirty building, nasty garbage in the parking lot, bars on the windows of the building where shady looking people, (think old drug addicts and alcoholics still exsisted. Hurray! 
Ordered 3 carne asada tacos that instantly brought back good memories. This is what I was looking for in a Carne Asada taco! The meat was marinated and so tender you didn't need teeth to eat it. The cilantro was fresh, onions chopped small and did not overwhelm the tacos. Salsa was tasty and very spicy. The tacos were served with rajas, sliced pickled peppers, carrots, and a juicy wedge of lemon (yes, lemon not dried out lime). 
Whoever is cooking these tacos/meats takes a lot of PRIDE in their craft and I for one appreciate it a lot! 
My taco crawl/Quest is over. If and when I get my antojitos for carne asada ghetto fabulous tacos I will be dining ""On the Other side of the tracks""/Ghetto
If you go to Imperios liquor store/taqueria don't expect to sit down and eat. If you don't eat in your car (with the doors locked) then you will have to eat standing up like a horse outside by the barred windows on the dirty shelf read (str8 nasty). You might get lucky and get the only stool and 3 feet long or smaller counter inside the store, but don't hold your breath. I would not take it To-Go because by the time you get home your food is guaranteed to be soggy.
****Update****
Unbelievable, I'm on a role here. The Universe listens to what I asked for. I went back to Imperios on the East side/ghetto only this time I brought back my wife. This is for sure NOT the type of places I take her or is she accustomed to. (Think high Fem) I could tell she was nervous as she noticed the ""type"" of people going in and out of the store. Most of them were old alcoholics buying booze, missing teeth and drug addicts lurking in the parking lot. (You can tell if your Street Smart)
I made sure to block/protective barrier her in as she was at the 3 foot counter with the only stool. This was she would feel ""protected"" as she tried the various tacos she ordered. Cabeza, Asada, Seso's (talk about 'hardcore' no thanks I'll stick with the Asada meat.
She loved the tacos, not the environment. I made jokes to ease her mind. I'm a pretty big guy like in muscular and tall so I know she felt protected. This is not the kind of place she would bring her Co-workers too...alone LOL 
Read the good part now.****Update****
Thinking of Imperios Asada tacos but not wanting to go All the way to ""The Other side of the Tracks"" I decided to try Imperios ll on Delma's Ave in San Jose, CA I did not have high hopes/expectations. Ordered 4 Carne Asada tacos as I made small talk with the nice gentleman. I wanted to know if the same owner owned both Imperios and how long Imperios ll taqueria has been there. He said it was owned by the same owner which was a good sign to me. I know for a fact Imperios has been around for 30 years. The new Imperios on Delma's has been there for 8 months today is May 11, 2016.
The gentleman at Imperios was very friendly, great Customer Service skills and really served me a generous amount of the most soft, tasty, delicious Asada meat. This particular Imperios Taqueria is located in the Delmas Market and is very Clean and updated. I appreciate that. I can see them making my tacos in front of me which I like. VIP Tacos"
38,Sophie L.,4.0,2016-04-19,"Good food 
Cheap prices 
Convenient-ish location 

If you're near the Caltrain or VTA station and hungry, make your way to this convenient store and you'll find a taco shop of goodness.  

Yes it's true, the cook washes his hands A LOT, which is not something I'm complaining about. I trie the carne asada super burrito (with cheese and avocado) for $7. He'll throw in a small container of hot sauce, but if you like spicy food, make sure to ask for an extra one."
39,Aldouse H.,5.0,2016-03-09,"Plain and simple:  its a legit taco place

nothing fancy, nothing exotic, just your legit taqueria.  
its ridiculously clean.  the guy running it seriously washes his hands often.  The rice, beans, salsa, meats are all delish.  It doesnt taste oily like some other places i've been to.  

my order was a carne asada taco and an al pastor super burrito.  total was $9.xx  good price if you ask me.  

its located on the corner of Delmas Ave and San Fernando.  Right across the light rail station.  You can argue the neighborhood can be a bit questionable; but really its not bad.  

Bring cash!  they dont accept cards.  There's an ATM machine inside the mini-mart though if you need."
40,Viri A.,5.0,2017-02-02,"Hands down! Best burrito in town. Don't get mislead by the sketchy market. The kitchen is immaculate clean! I love it and it never makes me sick!!! Which is very important for me, I have a very sensitive tummy but I looove food. My only comment would be that sometimes I tell them without onions or salsa and they forget but the burrito is so good I still eat it."
41,Gregory B.,4.0,2015-12-20,"Love this place. First, its right on my way home and just across from the light rail. Super convenient. The food is fresh and delicious. Kitchen is kept clean and the guy behind the counter washes up before making my order every time. I always get a carnitas burrito and its very good and the portions are huge.

Complaints are few but deserve to be mentioned. First, the neighborhood can be shady so keep your wits about you. Second, the salsa selection is lacking, I dont need 25 varieties but how about a salsa verde option?

All in all, really good. Good enough that I stop there once a week or so."
42,Alivia R.,5.0,2017-08-09,I love this place closest thing I'm going to get to an authentic street taco ...It's savory and seasoned... simply satisfying
43,Josh S.,4.0,2017-01-26,Went here before a concert at SAP center after reading about it on yelp.  The tacos were amazing and greatly priced.  A little skeptical at first because it was in a convenience store but that is gone.  I will definitely go here again when I'm in SJ and looking for some tacos.
44,Crissy V.,5.0,2017-01-17,"Hands down best burritos in SJ. And I've had a lot of burritos. Owner is great, and the food is delicious. Trust me I'm Mexican! Good price, and we all know that cash only places are usually the best tasting."
45,Michael Y.,5.0,2017-07-06,"Hole in the wall taqueria in a neighborhood market. Small menu of burritos, tortas, and tacos. My carnitas super burrito was excellent. Very tasty with a saut√©ed tortilla. Reasonably priced too!"
46,Ilya N.,5.0,2017-01-12,I think this is the best place around. Good food fair price. And the owner is really nice too
47,El G.,5.0,2017-01-29,Delicious tacos and super friendly. The steak tacos are particularly good.
48,Irvin Y.,5.0,2017-05-01,Hard to beat this place for the portion size and price.  Plus the food is simple but good.  A good place for a cheap tasty meal.
49,Zhirafo V.,1.0,2016-10-09,Stay away of this hole. The guys who work there are a rare a$$holes.
50,Bella A.,5.0,2016-06-28,One word when I bit into the juicy shrimp taco: WOW!  The burrito is also super tasty with tender steak that is tasty and juicy.  The price is reasonable for the portion of food. They are so fresh! I am also very surprise how clean the kitchen is maintained and it shares floor space with a liquor store!  There is no seating and trust me you want to get away from the area ASAP after you got your yummies.  There are old dudes without teeth coming into the shop for alcohol.  They seem harmless though but you never know lol.
51,Monika H.,5.0,2016-03-08,I usually stop at this little taqueria for carne asada or chicken tacos or burritos whenever I am in Delmas Market or near the Delmas neighborhood.  The food is inexpensive and REALLY good.
52,Anna V.,5.0,2016-08-19,"Honestly the best burrito spot. Not greasy, meat didn't have fat on it, fixing were fresh. Prices are cheap. Don't be scared especially late night. Just make sure to buddy up, it is downtown.  This is definitely my new spot."
53,Michaela R.,5.0,2016-05-05,"Perfect burritos with legit chiles! Clean kitchen, super friendly staff who are careful about making your food look and taste just right. Perfect for a burrito on the go! Grab a drink and candy at the market - mix and match style :)"
54,Aaron L.,4.0,2016-07-31,"Located close to the light rail inside a liquor store, you can get a really good shrimp burrito. I was able to get one for 8 bucks. Had a good spice to it and the salsa that comes with it was perfect."
55,Monica W.,5.0,2017-09-16,Enormous sized burrito! Fresh ingredients and delicious combinations! Highly recommended!
56,Rico D.,2.0,2017-07-13,"Burrito didn't really have any flavor. I got a super Carne asada burrito.  Rice a little over cooked and broken, beans whole but kinda blended.  Seems like they blend them enough to stretch them but keep them whole enough.  Burrito kinda mushed together.  I am not a burrito snob but I do prefer a burrito that retains its' parts throughout the meal."
57,Robert P.,5.0,2016-03-25,"First off I was happy to have another taco option in the neighborhood.
The place is very clean and the cook washed his hands after touching money or assisting customers.
I had 4 tacos with carne asana and hot red salsa.
The meat was tender and had a good flavor, tortillas were very good also.
My wife had shrimp tacos and said they had very good flavor which is not always easy with grilled shrimp.....overall we both loved the place and will be back....."
58,Maggie P.,5.0,2017-04-25,"I like this place! It's inside a corner store but it's an awesome find! I usually get their $2 tacos. Al pastor, carne asada and carnitas are all good!"
59,Ethan B.,5.0,2016-07-04,"Got the shrimp burrito.  Yum!  It is huge, with a lot of shrimp.  This was lunch and dinner.  I'd go back if I lived closer."
60,Kolin S.,4.0,2017-05-16,"Some may be turned off because it's located in a liquor store, but don't let that scare you. This place is pretty good, I've only been once but can't wait to go again. Took away a star because it's cash only."
